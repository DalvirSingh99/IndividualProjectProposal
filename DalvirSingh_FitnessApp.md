# IndividualProjectProposal

## A one paragraph description of the overall project 
The application I want to create is a fitness app that people can use to track and manage their health. The application will allow users to track their weight, daily steps, glucose levels, calories intake, heart rate, blood pressure  and alot more. The app will encourage consumers to take an active role in their health management by offering rewards and other incentives to improve your health. The application will contain videos which offer educational lessons about how to   reduce cholesterol, blood pressure, and more. Another aspect of the app would be an exercise tab, which will have videos of  different muscle groups you can workout. Another functionality of the app will be that the user can interact with a physician  to ask any questions you may have about better managing your health.
	
# A short explanation of how the proposal  is linked to the educational goals of this class (slide 7).                  
The proposal is linked to the educational goals of this class because the creation of this app will be  a group effort. With multiple programmers we will need to utilize version control(Git) so each programmer can carry out their task with ease. To produce this application, I will need the help of multiple programmers to code different functionalities. In order to develop this application, we will need to create a UML model for the developers. Having a UML model will allow everyone in the team to see the different functionalities of the app and how their role in the app contributes to the overall application. Furthermore, this application will require a graphic user interface so consumers can easily interact with the application and its functionalities. The app will also interact with a database which will contain the list of all the members who have registered for the app. The database will keep track of all their information from weight to much more. Having a database will help to keep persistent data on the user/consumer which will help to show how their health changed over time. Furthermore, if we want this app to be successful we will need to create many tests to check each functionality.
## A one paragraph description of your proposed contribution
Due to my experience in full stack development from my internship, I could contribute to any of the needed skills from front end development to back end development. I would prefer to work on the front end development because I want to enhance my front end development skills. I can create a dynamic web page using React that will allow the users to interact with the different functionalities of the app, such as inserting data to visualize their data.From my experience with sql, I could also wire the application to a database after creating schemas and models for the database. Also, I have microservice experience so I can create small ruby microservices and add them to the application as needed. Overall, with my experience, there are many parts of the project that I can contribute to and can help others with.
